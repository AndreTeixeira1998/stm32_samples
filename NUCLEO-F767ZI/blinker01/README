See the previous level README for schematic and programmers reference
information.

The generic nucleo board documentation says there are three user
leds.

//PA5 or PB0 defaults to PB0
//PB7
//PB14

The default/as-shipped solder bridges set the first led on PB0.  So
we only need to mess with GPIOB ports for this one.

This example blinks all three user leds.
