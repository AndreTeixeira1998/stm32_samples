See the previous level README for schematic and programmers reference
information.

So this is the baseline for projects.  The chip comes up using HSI
at 16Mhz, the HSE is 8MHz, this example uses the PLL to multiply that
to 16MHz.  If you have the HSE of 8Mhz then use this example, or
you can comment out the clock_init and use this example with the
HSI (16Mhz)
