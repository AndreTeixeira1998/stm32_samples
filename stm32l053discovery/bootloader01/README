See the previous level README for schematic and programmers reference
information.

Derived from uart02.  Not really needed for this board since you can
simply copy a .bin to the virtual flash drive.  But still, got the
uart working so why not.

The uart turned out to be trickly only because there is an LPUSART1
and a USART1 and I had them confused, was enabling one in one place and
the other in another, had to get all the ducks in a row.  In trying to
get it to work I trashed an ftdi breakout board and either rx or tx
(likely, dont remember now) on the stlink side of one of these boards.
Good thing I bought more than one.
