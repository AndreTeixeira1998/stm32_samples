information.

I dont have the stm32.brd boards yet, so using the DWSTM32.brd from
the DWSTM32 example which uses PA4 and PA5.  Will remedy this when I
get the other boards.

My purpose for buying these chips is ultra low power.  So slowed the
clock down to 64Khz give or take.  Lightly blinking the leds.

This runs from flash.  so like 20 microamps perhaps?

GPIO adds another 6 or 7 microamps.

Will see, dont know if I can mesure that small, but can say charge up
a cap and let it run off of that down and measure how long befoer it
dies.
