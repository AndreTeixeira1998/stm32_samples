Same as blinker03 except it switches to the external clock first.

The schematic shows that the external clock is 8MHz, so we have to wonder
if we really switched or not since the internal clock is also 8MHz.

As described in blinker04 a safety measure is in place.  If this
bricks the microcontroller, then press and hold the user button, then
press the reset button, when it comes out of reset it will see the
user button pressed and not enter the code that messes with clocks
(and is likely what bricked the board).  This is mostly for me since
if you are reading this then this code works and does not brick the
board, and here if you change this code to protect you.
